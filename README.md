# Sorting Visualizer
Welcome to my Sorting Visualizer Project, I built this project beacuse I was curious about sorting algorithm and I started to learn it and then I wanted to visualize it and also make the pseudo code animation also so it's not just visualize the sorting number but also the process behind it.
